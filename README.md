# Body-Detection
Body Detection Model that detects the landmarks. It is made using Holistic Model in the Mediapipe library of Python.
<br><br>

I used the MediaPipe Holistic Model that consists of a pipeline with the optimized pose, face and hand components that each run in real-time, with minimum memory transfer.
<br><br>
It can enable a variety of impactful applications, such as Fitness & Sports Analysis, Gesture Control and Sign Language Recognition, Augmented Reality effects and more.

I would love to hear your thoughts & opinion.
